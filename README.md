The implementations and the report were made for the second assignment of the course Parallel Computing at Radboud University, cohort 2018.
The task was to create an initial OpenCL version, an OpenCL version optimized for the GPU and an OpenCL version optimized for the CPU for the given Heat Diffusion algorithm. In the report we analyze the runtime effects of the changes we have made in the different attempts.
